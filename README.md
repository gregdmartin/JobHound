# JobHound
Author: Greg Martin

## Project Description
The hunt for a job can be difficult. Some of the things that make it difficult:
* You may be dealing with many people at once, including recruiters, hiring managers, in-company contacts, etc.
* You are likely dealing with more than one company at once, and tracking what step you are in the process with them can be difficult.
* Related to above, keeping track of who owns the next action and what it is can be tough.
* It's easy to overload yourself or create double bookings if you can't easily visualize when things are scheduled.
* If a long period of time passes between interactions, it can be difficult to tell what the last step was.

The purpose of this project is to ease all of those problems by providing a simple interface that allows a person to create profiles for companies/recruitment resources, contacts associated with those, and job hunt 'events', which are scheduled actions that move the job hunting process forward with a company.

## Why This Project?
I found myself using Google Calendar and a spreadsheet in order to track information about my job hunt. It kept getting confusing because I had two different sets of data to keep in sync, and there wasn't a good way to look at previous actions. I decided that while I'm looking for my next job, I should solve my own problem using my skill set (software development). This will prove to be a fun project I can work on while I continue my search, and will hopefully become a good showcase of what I am capable of to others. Who knows, it might even be useful enough for someone to use!
